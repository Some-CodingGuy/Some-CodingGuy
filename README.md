# Welcome to my Github! #

I am a Cloud Developer, which means I deal with the magic happening behind the scenes of a website. Do you need your website to communicate with a database and ask if your credentials are registered there? That's me. Do you need your webapp to communicate with an api and show a different theme depending on the hour of the day? Yep, that's me. Do you... I think you get the idea ðŸ˜‰

### ðŸ’¬ Interests ###

Lately I've been learning about cybersecurity, from pentesting techniques to networking, and everything in between. At the moment I'm trying to learn to write my own tools, making my own gadgets, etc... 
For example a Rubber Ducky: a USB device that when connected to a machine will start executing commands without the owner's consent.
